#   Part One:


#   FIXME: Declare variables
#   Declare two variables: an integer named "age", and a string named "name" with corresponding values (your name and age)

#   FIXME: Print
#   Print the following sentence in the console "You are NAME and you are AGE years old !". Don't forget to add a newline at the end
print("You are {0} and you are {1} years old!".format(name, age))

#   FiXME: Concatenation
#   Create a new string variable called "hello" which value is "Hello ". Add "name" at the end of "hello" (Concatenation) then print it
hello = 'Hello '
hello = hello + name
print(hello)

#   FIXME: Array
#   create a new string array called "shoppingList", with three elements of your choice. Create an int variable containing the number of
#   elements in "shoppingList" (using a function of the array/using the array)

# FIXME: If-statement
#   Modify the first for-loop (with i from 1 to 10) such that it prints "(value of i) is even" when "i" is divisible
#   by 2 (You may want to learn more about "modulo" (%)). Else, print "(value of i) is odd".

# FIXME: Sum Up
#   Create a string variable called "element" with the value of your choice. Then create a for-loop that checks if "shoppingList" contains

# Part Two:


#   FIXME: Functions - Ascii
#   Create a function that returns nothing and which doesn't takes any parameter. It should just be named "TriForce"

#   between 1 and 9 in each of the 9 rooms.
#   You may use one of the two previously created function.

# FIXME: Switch
#   Create a Switch that takes an integer "a" and return a sentence regarding the value of a
#   (Create 3 statements for 3 specific values and a default one)
